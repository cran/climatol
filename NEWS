HISTORY OF CHANGES IN climatol

2025-05-28, version 4.2.0:
- csv2climatol: Now enabled to process subdaily data.
- dahstat: Added option stat='mseries' to output homgenized monthly aggregates
  to a CSV file.
  - No longer fails with an error when trusted reference series are not at the
    end of the datasets.
- dd2m: Series with less than 12 monthly data are removed from the output.
- homogen: A new initial check removes series with less than mindat data items.
  - The initial QC implements detection and deletion of spikes in the series,
    except if their probability distribution is very skewed. (niqd now defaults
    to c(4,6,1).)
  - The correlogram disregards correlations calculated with less than 10 data
    pairs.
  - Reciprocal outliers (same date and opposite sign in nearby stations) are
    reinstated by means of the datrestore function.
  - Deletes fragments with zero mean if std=2 (normal ratio normalization).
  - Zeroes are not excluded by default from the detection and deletion of long
    runs of identical values when series are not daily or subdaily.
  - raway is now a factor to apply to distances involving reanalysis series
    previously increased by the median distance between observational series.
  - onlyQC no longer saves the original data as *-QC_*, but as *-ori_*, as
    users sometimes thought they should continue working with the *-QC_* files.
- read.dat: Fixed bug in this internal function that failed to identify daily
  data.
- weekendaccum: New function to check for weekends or other days with false
  zero precipitation which actually has been accumulated. (Applicable to daily
  precipitation series only.)

2024-03-23, version 4.1.0:
- climatol2rclimdex: Issues message error in the absence of common station
  codes in the three variables involved.
- csv2climatol: Lines without observations are now disregarded.
- dahstat: Fixed bug when stat='series' and only one series was requested.
- daily2climatol: Columns of the data files may be only two if the first one
  contains dates in Date or POSIX format. Fixed bug in removing lines with no
  data.
- datrestore: New function to restore deleted outliers checked as true into
  the dah matrix of homogenized series contained in the *.rda output results.
- diagwl: Is now resistant to missing data in the input series, and the
  parameter shem is now guessed. Corrected inconsistencies between parameters
  yeari, yearf and per.
- fix.sunshine: Changes negative values to zeros.
- homogen:
  - Break-points in a single series with a single trusted reference are now
    adjusted without the need to set force=TRUE.
  - niqd defaults to c(4,1) instead of 3 to delete clearly wrong data and long
    runs of identical data (with niqd>1).
  - Fixed a problem that prevented to draw high resolution coastlines in the
    map of stations.
  - Fixed the bug of extra %d in sprintf("dahstat(...)#averages",...)
  - Outliers not deleted because of having only one reference are not plotted
    in red anymore in the final histogram of standardized anomalies.
  - New consistency check when data seem sub-daily.
  - boxplots and correlogram weight less and display faster in the output PDF.
- IDFcurves: Hourly data are now allowed and issues with the legend have been
  fixed.
- rclimdex2climatol: Fixed bug when reading the stations file.
- windrose: New parameters allow to choose the number of wind directions and to
define the wind speed classes.

2023-04-09, version 4.0.0:
- Only the three first parameters are needed in the homogen() function to
  process any climatic variable. The rest of parameters are guessed or have
  safe default values.
- This function begins now with a quality control checking for extreme values,
  increments into successive data and number of consecutive data of identical
  value.
- Precipitation data accumulated during several days can be dissaggregated.
- Optional data transformation has been removed because the ratio normalization
  yields better results.
- A new test (Cucconi) has been added which has the ability to detect both
  changes in mean and variance. SNHT is still de default test, but the
  thresholds are now named 'inht'.
- New utility functions to help in preparing input files with the required
  format: sef2climatol, xls2csv and csv2climatol
- The unsatisfactory experimental function homogsplit has been removed.
  Series in big domains with different climate regimes can be split providing
  code lists to datsubset().
- New tools: fix.sunshine to prune any excess in sunshine hours produced in
  adjusted daily series; and QCthresholds to obtain monthly quantiles of
  extreme values, increments between consecutive values and sequences of
  identical values.
- Added graphic products to display two dimensional scaterplots,
  Intensity-Duration-Frequency diagrams, diagrams of running trends on time
  windows of different lengths, Months-Hours isopleths and meteograms.

2018-05-04, version 3.1.1:
- Checking that station codes are not duplicated and do not include the '-'
  symbol.
- Important bug correction.

2018-04-15, version 3.1:
- New file conversion functions daily2climatol(), rclimdex2climatol and
  climatol2rclimdex().
- New function datsubset() to subset data into new input files.
- Bug correction in homogsplit().
- Bigger labels in graphics.

2016-08-27, version 3.0:
- Many novelties, with new functions (to prepare the input data from ODBC
  accessible data bases, to obtain grids from the homogenized series, etc) and
  new functionalities added to others.
- The package is now able to deal with daily data, and can honor stations
  metadata. (Be aware that some parameters change their names to be more
  mnemonic).

2013-11-01, version 2.2.1:
- Bug fixed: a global color re-assignment resulted in abnormal halt under most
  O.S.+latest R combination.

2013-10-01, version 2.2:
- Code optimization allows the process to be completed in around half the time
  of the previous version.
- Original series can be labeled as homogeneous to keep them unchanged.
- Some parameters have more meaningful names (the old are kept for backward
  compatibility), and a couple default values have been changed.
- dahstat() has a new option to yield the homogenized series in individual text
  files.
- A map is drawn in the station location figure if the package 'maps' is
  installed.

2011-06-05, version 2.1:
- Corrected bugs in distance and trend computations and an improved convergence
  in the missing data recomputation yiel much better homogenization results.

2011-01-25, version 2.0:
- Too many to be explained here. The main novelty is the homogen() function,
  for an automated homogenization of climatological series.
- Other functions have been changed or replaced, so you cannot expect
  compatibility with the 1.x versions.

2006-10-06, version 1.0.3:
- Change of 'Â°C' by just 'C' to avoid non-ascii characters warnings in the R
  checking process of the package.
- Update of the PDF poster of the documentation.

2006-05-26, version 1.0.2:
- Workaround to avoid 'Error: NAs are not allowed in subscripted assignments',
  produced when using option sqrtrans=TRUE in function depudm() since R version
  2.0.0.
- Minor corrections in the documentation.

01-Nov-2004, version 1.0:
- First public release.
