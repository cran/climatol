HISTORY OF CHANGES IN climatol

   Date     Version  Changes
----------- -------  -------------------------------------------------
25-Jan-2011     2.0  Too many to explain here. The main novelty is the
                     homogen() function, for an automated homogenization of
                     climatological series. Other functions have been changed
                     or replaced, so you cannot expect compatibility with the
                     1.x versions.
06-Oct-2006   1.0.3  Change of '°C' by just 'C' to avoid non-ascii characters
                     warnings in the R checking process of the package, and
                     update of the PDF poster of the documentation
26-May-2006   1.0.2  Minor corrections in the documentation and workaround
                     to avoid 'Error: NAs are not allowed in subscripted
                     assignments', produced when using option sqrtrans=TRUE
                     in function depudm() since R version 2.0.0 
01-Nov-2004     1.0  First public release
