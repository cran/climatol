HISTORY OF CHANGES IN Climatol

   Date     Version  Changes
----------- -------  -------------------------------------------------
05-Aug-2019   3.1.2  Fixed inconsistency in the name of a dataset.

04-May-2018   3.1.1  Checking that station codes are not duplicated and do
                     not include the '-' symbol. Important bug correction.

15-Apr-2018     3.1  New file conversion functions daily2climatol(),
                     rclimdex2climatol and climatol2rclimdex().
                     New function datsubset() to subset data into new input
                     files. Bug correction in homogsplit(). Bigger labels in
                     graphics.

27-Aug-2016     3.0  Many novelties, with new functions (to prepare the input
                     data from ODBC accessible data bases, to obtain grids
                     from the homogenized series, etc) and new functionalities
                     added to others. The package is now able to deal with
                     daily data, and can honor stations metadata. (Be aware
                     that some parameters change their names to be more
                     mnemonic).

01-Nov-2013   2.2.1  Bug fixed: a global color re-assignment resulted in
                     abnormal halt under most O.S.+latest R combination.

01-Oct-2013     2.2  Code optimization allows the process to be completed in
                     around half the time of the previous version. Original
                     series can be labeled as homogeneous to keep them
                     unchanged. Some parameters have more meaningful names (the
                     old are kept for backward compatibility), and a couple
                     default values have been changed. dahstat() has a new
                     option to yield the homogenized series in individual text
                     files. A map is drawn in the station location figure if
                     the package 'maps' is installed.

05-Jun-2011     2.1  Corrected bugs in distance and trend computations and an
                     improved convergence in the missing data recomputation
                     yiel much better homogenization results.

25-Jan-2011     2.0  Too many to explain here. The main novelty is the
                     homogen() function, for an automated homogenization of
                     climatological series. Other functions have been changed
                     or replaced, so you cannot expect compatibility with the
                     1.x versions.

06-Oct-2006   1.0.3  Change of '°C' by just 'C' to avoid non-ascii characters
                     warnings in the R checking process of the package, and
                     update of the PDF poster of the documentation.

26-May-2006   1.0.2  Minor corrections in the documentation and workaround
                     to avoid 'Error: NAs are not allowed in subscripted
                     assignments', produced when using option sqrtrans=TRUE
                     in function depudm() since R version 2.0.0.

01-Nov-2004     1.0  First public release.
