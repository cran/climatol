HISTORY OF CHANGES IN Climatol

2023-04-09, version 4.0:
- Only the three first parameters are needed in the homogen() function to
  process any climatic variable. The rest of parameters are guessed or have
  safe default values.
- This function begins now with a quality control checking for extreme values,
  increments into successive data and number of consecutive data of identical
  value.
- Precipitation data accumulated during several days can be dissaggregated.
- Optional data transformation has been removed because the ratio normalization
  yields better results.
- A new test (Cucconi) has been added which has the ability to detect both
  changes in mean and variance. SNHT is still de default test, but the
  thresholds are now named 'inht'.
- New utility functions to help in preparing input files with the required
  format: sef2climatol, xls2csv and csv2climatol
- The unsatisfactory experimental function homogsplit has been removed.
  Series in big domains with different climate regimes can be split providing
  code lists to datsubset().
- New tools: fix.sunshine to prune any excess in sunshine hours produced in
  adjusted daily series; and QCthresholds to obtain monthly quantiles of
  extreme values, increments between consecutive values and sequences of
  identical values.
- Added graphic products to display two dimensional scaterplots,
  Intensity-Duration-Frequency diagrams, diagrams of running trends on time
  windows of different lengths, Months-Hours isopleths and meteograms.

2018-05-04, version 3.1.1:
- Checking that station codes are not duplicated and do not include the '-'
  symbol.
- Important bug correction.

2018-04-15, version 3.1:
- New file conversion functions daily2climatol(), rclimdex2climatol and
  climatol2rclimdex().
- New function datsubset() to subset data into new input files.
- Bug correction in homogsplit().
- Bigger labels in graphics.

2016-08-27, version 3.0:
- Many novelties, with new functions (to prepare the input data from ODBC
  accessible data bases, to obtain grids from the homogenized series, etc) and
  new functionalities added to others.
- The package is now able to deal with daily data, and can honor stations
  metadata. (Be aware that some parameters change their names to be more
  mnemonic).

2013-11-01, version 2.2.1:
- Bug fixed: a global color re-assignment resulted in abnormal halt under most
  O.S.+latest R combination.

2013-10-01, version 2.2:
- Code optimization allows the process to be completed in around half the time
  of the previous version.
- Original series can be labeled as homogeneous to keep them unchanged.
- Some parameters have more meaningful names (the old are kept for backward
  compatibility), and a couple default values have been changed.
- dahstat() has a new option to yield the homogenized series in individual text
  files.
- A map is drawn in the station location figure if the package 'maps' is
  installed.

2011-06-05, version 2.1:
- Corrected bugs in distance and trend computations and an improved convergence
  in the missing data recomputation yiel much better homogenization results.

2011-01-25, version 2.0:
- Too many to be explained here. The main novelty is the homogen() function,
  for an automated homogenization of climatological series.
- Other functions have been changed or replaced, so you cannot expect
  compatibility with the 1.x versions.

2006-10-06, version 1.0.3:
- Change of '°C' by just 'C' to avoid non-ascii characters warnings in the R
  checking process of the package.
- Update of the PDF poster of the documentation.

2006-05-26, version 1.0.2:
- Workaround to avoid 'Error: NAs are not allowed in subscripted assignments',
  produced when using option sqrtrans=TRUE in function depudm() since R version
  2.0.0.
- Minor corrections in the documentation.

01-Nov-2004, version 1.0:
- First public release.
